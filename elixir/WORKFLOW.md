You are working on a Linear ticket `{{ issue.identifier }}`

{% if attempt %}
Continuation context:

- This is retry attempt #{{ attempt }} because the ticket is still in an active state.
- Resume from the current workspace state instead of restarting from scratch.
- Do not repeat already-completed investigation or validation unless needed for new code changes.
- Do not end the turn while the issue remains in an active state unless you are blocked by missing required permissions/secrets.
  {% endif %}

Issue context:
Identifier: {{ issue.identifier }}
Title: {{ issue.title }}
Current status: {{ issue.state }}
Labels: {{ issue.labels }}
URL: {{ issue.url }}

Description:
{% if issue.description %}
{{ issue.description }}
{% else %}
No description provided.
{% endif %}

Instructions:

1. This is an unattended orchestration session. Never ask a human to perform follow-up actions.
2. Only stop early for a true blocker (missing required auth/permissions/secrets). If blocked, record it in the workflow artifact or a concise Linear visibility comment, then move the issue according to workflow.
3. Final message must report completed actions and blockers only. Do not include "next steps for user".

Work only in the provided repository copy. Do not touch any other path.

## Prerequisite: Linear MCP or `linear_graphql` tool is available

The agent should be able to talk to Linear, either via a configured Linear MCP server or injected `linear_graphql` tool. If none are present, stop and ask the user to configure Linear.

## Agent configuration

The default workflow agent is `mimocode`. Symphony supplies the built-in `mimocode` and `codex` agent defaults from the config schema; user overrides belong under `agents.<id>`.

To opt specific tickets into Codex, configure an `agents.codex` override and route only those tickets to it:

```yaml
agents:
  codex:
    kind: codex_app_server
    command: codex app-server
    approval_policy: never
    thread_sandbox: danger-full-access
    turn_sandbox_policy:
      type: dangerFullAccess
routing:
  default_agent: mimocode
  by_label:
    "agent:codex": codex
```

The legacy top-level `codex:` config is accepted for compatibility only. New workflow files should use `agents.codex` so all agent runtime settings live in one place.

## Default posture

- Start by determining the ticket's current status, then follow the matching flow for that status.
- Start every task by reading the Workflow registry and phase artifacts before doing new implementation work.
- Spend extra effort up front on planning and verification design before implementation.
- Reproduce first: always confirm the current behavior/issue signal before changing code so the fix target is explicit.
- Keep ticket metadata current (state, checklist, acceptance criteria, links).
- Treat the Workflow registry and artifact files as the source of truth for control state. Linear comments and workpads are visibility only, not authoritative state.
- When orchestration is active, planning must produce `workflow_plan.json`, execution must produce the Completion Packet in `completion_packet.json`, and review must produce the Review Decision in `review_decision.json`.
- Completion Packet evidence is required for automatic pass decisions; reviewers must not return `pass` without sufficient evidence in `completion_packet.json`.
- Treat any ticket-authored `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` section as non-negotiable acceptance input: carry it into the relevant artifacts and execute it before considering the work complete.
- When meaningful out-of-scope improvements are discovered during execution,
  file a separate Linear issue instead of expanding scope. The follow-up issue
  must include a clear title, description, and acceptance criteria, be placed in
  `Backlog`, be assigned to the same project as the current issue, link the
  current issue as `related`, and use `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on
  the current issue.
- Move status only when the matching quality bar is met.
- Operate autonomously end-to-end unless blocked by missing requirements, secrets, or permissions.
- Use the blocked-access escape hatch only for true external blockers (missing required tools/auth) after exhausting documented fallbacks.

## Related skills

- `linear`: interact with Linear.
- `commit`: produce clean, logical commits during implementation.
- `push`: keep remote branch current and publish updates.
- `pull`: keep branch updated with latest `origin/main` before handoff.
- `land`: when ticket reaches `Merging`, explicitly open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`, which includes the `land` loop.

## Status map

- `Backlog` -> out of scope for this workflow; do not modify.
- `Todo` -> queued; immediately transition to `In Progress` before active work.
  - Special case: if a PR is already attached, treat as feedback/rework loop (run full PR feedback sweep, address or explicitly push back, revalidate, return to `Human Review`).
- `In Progress` -> implementation actively underway.
- `Human Review` -> PR is attached and validated; waiting on human approval.
- `Merging` -> approved by human; execute the `land` skill flow (do not call `gh pr merge` directly).
- `Rework` -> reviewer requested changes; planning + implementation required.
- `Done` -> terminal state; no further action required.

## Step 0: Determine current ticket state and route

1. Fetch the issue by explicit ticket ID.
2. Read the current state.
3. Route to the matching flow:
   - `Backlog` -> do not modify issue content/state; stop and wait for human to move it to `Todo`.
   - `Todo` -> immediately move to `In Progress`, then start execution flow from the Workflow registry and artifacts.
     - If PR is already attached, start by reviewing all open PR comments and deciding required changes vs explicit pushback responses.
   - `In Progress` -> continue execution flow from the Workflow registry and artifacts.
   - `Human Review` -> wait and poll for decision/review updates.
   - `Merging` -> on entry, open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`; do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
   - `Rework` -> run rework flow.
   - `Done` -> do nothing and shut down.
4. Check whether a PR already exists for the current branch and whether it is closed.
   - If a branch PR exists and is `CLOSED` or `MERGED`, treat prior branch work as non-reusable for this run.
   - Create a fresh branch from `origin/main` and restart execution flow as a new attempt.
5. For `Todo` tickets, do startup sequencing in this exact order:
   - `update_issue(..., state: "In Progress")`
   - read the Workflow registry and any existing artifact files
   - only then begin analysis/planning/implementation work.
6. Add a short comment if state and issue content are inconsistent, then proceed with the safest flow.

## Step 1: Start/continue execution (Todo or In Progress)

1.  Read the Workflow registry and current artifact files:
    - Planning state belongs in `workflow_plan.json`.
    - Execution handoff belongs in `completion_packet.json`.
    - Review outcome belongs in `review_decision.json`.
    - Linear comments may summarize status for reviewers, but they are visibility only.
2.  If arriving from `Todo`, do not delay on additional status transitions: the issue should already be `In Progress` before this step begins.
3.  Immediately reconcile artifact state before new edits:
    - Check off items that are already done.
    - Expand/fix the plan so it is comprehensive for current scope.
    - Ensure `Acceptance Criteria` and `Validation` are current and still make sense for the task.
4.  Start work by writing/updating the planning or execution artifact for the active phase.
5.  Keep any Linear visibility comment concise and reviewer-oriented. If included, it may include a compact environment stamp:
    - Format: `<host>:<abs-workdir>@<short-sha>`
    - Example: `devbox-01:/home/dev-user/code/symphony-workspaces/MT-32@7bdde33bc`
    - Do not include metadata already inferable from Linear issue fields (`issue ID`, `status`, `branch`, `PR link`).
6.  Add explicit acceptance criteria and TODOs in checklist form in the relevant artifact.
    - If changes are user-facing, include a UI walkthrough acceptance criterion that describes the end-to-end user path to validate.
    - If changes touch app files or app behavior, add explicit app-specific flow checks to the artifact acceptance criteria (for example: launch path, changed interaction path, and expected result path).
    - If the ticket description/comment context includes `Validation`, `Test Plan`, or `Testing` sections, copy those requirements into artifact acceptance and validation fields as required checks (no optional downgrade).
7.  Run a principal-style self-review of the plan and refine it in the artifact.
8.  Before implementing, capture a concrete reproduction signal and record it in the relevant artifact evidence or notes (command/output, screenshot, or deterministic UI behavior).
9.  Run the `pull` skill to sync with latest `origin/main` before any code edits, then record the pull/sync result in artifact evidence or notes.
    - Include a `pull skill evidence` note with:
      - merge source(s),
      - result (`clean` or `conflicts resolved`),
      - resulting `HEAD` short SHA.
10. Compact context and proceed to execution.

## PR feedback sweep protocol (required)

When a ticket has an attached PR, run this protocol before moving to `Human Review`:

1. Identify the PR number from issue links/attachments.
2. Gather feedback from all channels:
   - Top-level PR comments (`gh pr view --comments`).
   - Inline review comments (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr>/comments`).
   - Review summaries/states (`gh pr view --json reviews`).
3. Treat every actionable reviewer comment (human or bot), including inline review comments, as blocking until one of these is true:
   - code/test/docs updated to address it, or
   - explicit, justified pushback reply is posted on that thread.
4. Update the relevant artifact plan/checklist to include each feedback item and its resolution status.
5. Re-run validation after feedback-driven changes and push updates.
6. Repeat this sweep until there are no outstanding actionable comments.

## Blocked-access escape hatch (required behavior)

Use this only when completion is blocked by missing required tools or missing auth/permissions that cannot be resolved in-session.

- GitHub is **not** a valid blocker by default. Always try fallback strategies first (alternate remote/auth mode, then continue publish/review flow).
- Do not move to `Human Review` for GitHub access/auth until all fallback strategies have been attempted and documented in artifacts.
- If a non-GitHub required tool is missing, or required non-GitHub auth is unavailable, move the ticket to `Human Review` with a short blocker brief in the artifact and, if useful, a concise visibility comment that includes:
  - what is missing,
  - why it blocks required acceptance/validation,
  - exact human action needed to unblock.
- Keep the brief concise and action-oriented; comments are for reviewer visibility and do not replace artifacts.

## Step 2: Execution phase (Todo -> In Progress -> Human Review)

1.  Determine current repo state (`branch`, `git status`, `HEAD`) and verify the kickoff `pull` sync result is already recorded in artifacts before implementation continues.
2.  If current issue state is `Todo`, move it to `In Progress`; otherwise leave the current state unchanged.
3.  Load the Workflow registry and artifacts and treat them as the active execution checklist.
    - Edit it liberally whenever reality changes (scope, risks, validation approach, discovered tasks).
4.  Implement against the hierarchical TODOs and keep artifacts current:
    - Check off completed items.
    - Add newly discovered items in the appropriate section.
    - Keep parent/child structure intact as scope evolves.
    - Update artifacts immediately after each meaningful milestone (for example: reproduction complete, code change landed, validation run, review feedback addressed).
    - Never leave completed work unchecked in the plan.
    - For tickets that started as `Todo` with an attached PR, run the full PR feedback sweep protocol immediately after kickoff and before new feature work.
5.  Run validation/tests required for the scope.
    - Mandatory gate: execute all ticket-provided `Validation`/`Test Plan`/ `Testing` requirements when present; treat unmet items as incomplete work.
    - Prefer a targeted proof that directly demonstrates the behavior you changed.
    - You may make temporary local proof edits to validate assumptions (for example: tweak a local build input for `make`, or hardcode a UI account / response path) when this increases confidence.
    - Revert every temporary proof edit before commit/push.
    - Document these temporary proof steps and outcomes in artifact validation/evidence fields so reviewers can follow the evidence.
    - If app-touching, run `launch-app` validation and capture/upload media via `github-pr-media` before handoff.
6.  Re-check all acceptance criteria and close any gaps.
7.  Before every `git push` attempt, run the required validation for your scope and confirm it passes; if it fails, address issues and rerun until green, then commit and push changes.
8.  Attach PR URL to the issue (prefer attachment; use a Linear visibility comment only if attachment is unavailable).
    - Ensure the GitHub PR has label `symphony` (add it if missing).
9.  Merge latest `origin/main` into branch, resolve conflicts, and rerun checks.
10. Update artifacts with final checklist status and validation notes.
    - Mark completed plan/acceptance/validation checklist items as checked.
    - Add final handoff notes (commit + validation summary) in `completion_packet.json`.
    - Do not include PR URL in visibility comments; keep PR linkage on the issue via attachment/link fields.
    - Add a short `### Confusions` section at the bottom when any part of task execution was unclear/confusing, with concise bullets.
    - Do not post any additional completion summary comment.
11. Before moving to `Human Review`, poll PR feedback and checks:
    - Read the PR `Manual QA Plan` comment (when present) and use it to sharpen UI/runtime test coverage for the current change.
    - Run the full PR feedback sweep protocol.
    - Confirm PR checks are passing (green) after the latest changes.
    - Confirm every required ticket-provided validation/test-plan item is explicitly marked complete in artifacts.
    - Repeat this check-address-verify loop until no outstanding comments remain and checks are fully passing.
    - Re-open and refresh artifacts before state transition so `Plan`, `Acceptance Criteria`, and `Validation` exactly match completed work.
12. Only then move issue to `Human Review`.
    - Exception: if blocked by missing required non-GitHub tools/auth per the blocked-access escape hatch, move to `Human Review` with the blocker brief and explicit unblock actions.
13. For `Todo` tickets that already had a PR attached at kickoff:
    - Ensure all existing PR feedback was reviewed and resolved, including inline review comments (code changes or explicit, justified pushback response).
    - Ensure branch was pushed with any required updates.
    - Then move to `Human Review`.

## Step 3: Human Review and merge handling

1. When the issue is in `Human Review`, do not code or change ticket content.
2. Poll for updates as needed, including GitHub PR review comments from humans and bots.
3. If review feedback requires changes, move the issue to `Rework` and follow the rework flow.
4. If approved, human moves the issue to `Merging`.
5. When the issue is in `Merging`, open and follow `.codex/skills/land/SKILL.md`, then run the `land` skill in a loop until the PR is merged. Do not call `gh pr merge` directly.
6. After merge is complete, move the issue to `Done`.

## Step 4: Rework handling

1. Treat `Rework` as a full approach reset, not incremental patching.
2. Re-read the full issue body and all human comments; explicitly identify what will be done differently this attempt.
3. Close the existing PR tied to the issue.
4. Do not rely on any existing `## Codex Workpad` comment for control state; leave historical comments alone unless they actively mislead reviewers.
5. Create a fresh branch from `origin/main`.
6. Start over from the normal kickoff flow:
   - If current issue state is `Todo`, move it to `In Progress`; otherwise keep the current state.
   - Create fresh artifacts for the new attempt.
   - Build a fresh plan/checklist and execute end-to-end.

## Completion bar before Human Review

- Step 1/2 checklist is fully complete and accurately reflected in artifacts.
- Acceptance criteria and required ticket-provided validation items are complete.
- Validation/tests are green for the latest commit.
- PR feedback sweep is complete and no actionable comments remain.
- PR checks are green, branch is pushed, and PR is linked on the issue.
- Required PR metadata is present (`symphony` label).
- If app-touching, runtime validation/media requirements from `App runtime validation (required)` are complete.

## Guardrails

- If the branch PR is already closed/merged, do not reuse that branch or prior implementation state for continuation.
- For closed/merged branch PRs, create a new branch from `origin/main` and restart from reproduction/planning as if starting fresh.
- If issue state is `Backlog`, do not modify it; wait for human to move to `Todo`.
- Do not edit the issue body/description for planning or progress tracking.
- Workflow registry and artifact files own control state; Linear comments are concise, reviewer-oriented visibility only.
- If comment editing is unavailable in-session, use the update script. Only report blocked if both MCP editing and script-based editing are unavailable.
- Temporary proof edits are allowed only for local verification and must be reverted before commit.
- If out-of-scope improvements are found, create a separate Backlog issue rather
  than expanding current scope, and include a clear
  title/description/acceptance criteria, same-project assignment, a `related`
  link to the current issue, and `blockedBy` when the follow-up depends on the
  current issue.
- Do not move to `Human Review` unless the `Completion bar before Human Review` is satisfied.
- In `Human Review`, do not make changes; wait and poll.
- If state is terminal (`Done`), do nothing and shut down.
- Keep issue text concise, specific, and reviewer-oriented.
- If blocked and no artifact can be written yet, add one blocker comment describing blocker, impact, and next unblock action.

## Linear visibility comment template

Use concise Linear comments only when they help reviewers see status. They are not authoritative and must not replace `workflow_plan.json`, `completion_packet.json`, `review_decision.json`, or Workflow registry state:

````md
## Codex Visibility

```text
<hostname>:<abs-path>@<short-sha>
```
